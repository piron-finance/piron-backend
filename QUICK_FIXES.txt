[2025-11-26] DEPOSIT INDEXER - 10 BLOCK LIMIT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: src/blockchain/deposit-indexer.service.ts (line 64)

Issue:
- Alchemy Free tier only allows eth_getLogs requests with max 10 block range
- Indexer was trying to query 100+ blocks causing 400 errors
- Second user deposit not being indexed into database

Quick Fix Applied:
- Limited block range to 10 blocks per query: `Math.min(currentBlock, fromBlock + 9)`
- This slows down indexing but makes it work

Proper Solution Needed:
1. Upgrade to Alchemy PAYG plan (allows larger block ranges)
2. OR switch to different RPC provider (QuickNode, Infura, Ankr)
3. OR implement batching with retries for free tier
4. Consider adding pagination/chunking logic for historical syncs

Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH (works for now, but limits scalability)
Impact: Indexing speed, historical data sync
Cost: ~$50/month for Alchemy PAYG or similar
